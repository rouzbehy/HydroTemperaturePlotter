# Read Me

This is a very simple (at the moment!) repository for a python code that takes a hydrodynamic history file (binary, float32) and plots the temperature profile as a function of proper time. For some reason I've ended up doing this multiple times through my Ph.D. so I've finally decided to put it in a repo. 


I might add to this over time. It is much easier to read this file in Python than it is in C++. This could also form the backbone of my attempts to re-write MARTINI in Python or Go or something.

For now, it's just a repo to house a utility that I utilized often!
